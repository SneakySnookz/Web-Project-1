    <p><b>A mysterious "Helping Hand" has been reportedly wreaking havoc
      upon the Kormaxes.</b> The origins of this "Helping Hand" are unknown, but Kormin Reportants
      posted in the far north have questioned our cousin Kormax victims about the attacks.<br/>
      <i>"I never felt so terrified before in my short life!"</i><br/>Says Wikiwakalaka, a Kormax
      victim of the Hand.<br/><i>"I was lost when me and my friend Wakilamuka were adventuring.
      Then this scary humanoid came out of nowhere and flung me through the sky! Good thing
      I landed near Wakilamuka."</i><br/>The mysterious humanoid calls itself the "Helping Hand".
      We suggest all Kormaxes currently living in the Kormin Territories to stay indoors.<br/>

    <p><b>Maker-Kormin Swam-The-Seas from the North End has informed us of
      Kormax attempts to sue for "Ally Fraud", with threats of war.</b>
      <br/>Reportedly, the Kormax have been under attack by terrorist-beast 
      "Helping Hand", and have decided to call phony on the Kormin Governing Force for
      "Ally Fraud". Major Lakiluka of the Kormaxes believes the Kormins need to
      aid them in the capture of this <i>Hand</i>. The KGF's refusal to become
      associated, likely due to fear of the Hand's intentions, has caused anger
      from Lakiluka. Whether this will result in war or court is yet to be determined.
